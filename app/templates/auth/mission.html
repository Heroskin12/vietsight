                                <p class="w-lg-50">Imagine this. You arrive in a new city, perhaps for travel or maybe you are relocating, and you have no idea what to do.</p>
                                <p class="w-lg-50">Where should you eat? Where should you grab a drink? What cool places are there to visit?</p>
                                <p class="w-lg-50 mb-5">You might decide that in order to find answers to these questions, you should look up some travel blogs and see what they recommend.</p>

                                <img src="/static/images/halong3.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid w-lg-50 mb-1">

                                <p class="text-muted w-lg-50 text-center">The famous Bitexco Tower in Ho Chi Minh.</p>

                                <p class="w-lg-50 mt-3">It's not a bad idea, but there is a problem. All the travel blogs tend to recommend the same list of places. Most bloggers use other blogs to find places to go and tend to have the same experiences. It takes a lot of effort to find the 1 or 2 websites really offering anything different.</p>
                                <p class="w-lg-50"> It's a huge shame. Vietnam boasts thousands of little known local businesses, but oftentimes these hidden gems tend to be so much better and unique.</p>
                                <p class="w-lg-50">Now more than ever, local businesses are in need of support as they struggle to bounce back from the devastating impact of Covid-19.</p>
                                <p class="w-lg-50 mb-5">That's where VietSight comes in.</p>
