# vietsight
Vietsight is a social media website which aims to help expats and tourists in Vietnam to experience more of the local culture. 

A user can share the places they have been, as well as directions on how to get there, to other users on the website.
In addition, to never run out of ideas for things to do and places to go, users can store posts they like in their own personal bucket list. Items can be added and removed at will.
In future updates, I intend to make the bucket list feature more comprehensive, allowing for search when the list gets quite large, filtering, tagging and cateogirising. Users will also be able to share their lists with others.

The application is built in Flask for it's lightweight features and high-performance. It has been deployed on Heroku using AWS and Azure to support some of its features.

The site has reached a standard with which I am currently happy, but I am constantly updating it to improve it. If while using the site, you have any thoughts on how to improve it, feel free to reach out at jamiefurlong16@gmail.com for a conversation!

Thank you and enjoy your time using Vietsight.
